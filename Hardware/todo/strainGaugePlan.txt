VCC_5V -> LOAD SWITCH -> powers strain gauges

sensing strain gauges

Voltmeter(0-20mV) -> Amplified(Differential amplifier multiplexer) -> data fed to MCU via SP


Currently the power situation has not been confirmed. So I will ignore it


Another issue, we can only fit 6 differential inputs in the chosen ADC
