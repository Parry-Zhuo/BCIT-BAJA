Things to do


POWER SUPPLY
- High operating range buck convertor which feeds to 
- LDO goes to MCU
- Create load switches for the Strain gauge. Or just reuse LOAD SWITCH 1.
	-Need to change voltage input as 2.8V is no bueno.Ã“

MCU
 - contains antenna daughter board

PERIPHERALS/SENSORS:
- Strain gauge <-- I will be working on this 03/08 as other parts need to be verified
- find GYROSCOPE/ACCELEROMETER for KALMAN filtering
